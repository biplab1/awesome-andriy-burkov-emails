# awesome-andriy-burkov-emails
This repository is an archive of emails that are sent by Andriy Burkov (author of [The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book](http://themlbook.com/)) every week.
	
I joined the weekly newsletter late (in Feb 2021), so I would request if anyone has the previous emails, they can kindly help me update this repository with the Weekly from \#1 - \#18. </br>

This repository was inspired by another [awesome compilation](https://github.com/sourabh-joshi/awesome-quincy-larson-emails). Please do check out this repository.
