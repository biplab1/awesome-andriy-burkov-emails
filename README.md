### True Positive Weekly #19 (February 20, 2021)
The most important artificial intelligence and machine learning links of the week 
	
Andriy Burkov

Hey, in this issue: neural networks (maybe) evolved to make adam the best optimizer, most important statistical ideas of the past 50 years, enterprises are turning from TensorFlow to PyTorch, a general game-playing AI bot that excels at many games, do we really need green screens for high-quality real-time human matting, and more.
